# Day 1: Introduction to ML

*Semi-supervised learning of the electronic health record for phenotype stratification*

*Descriptions of data and algorithms*

Small n, large-p vs Small p, large-n o n-number of individuals in dataset, p-number of features for each individual

o Refers to shape of dataset (wide vs long) with each having specific set of challenges Parameters 
o a variable, internal to the model, and derived from the data; often saved as part of final model o Example: Î² in a regression model Hyperparameters 
o a variable, external to the model and often set by the programmer/analyst; used to estimate model parameters or to optimize the algorithm; can also be called tuning parameter o Example: number of trees in a random forest Tuning 

o Customization of a model by varying the hyperparameters to determine the values that provide the optimal performance Tidying o Structuring data to facilitate analysis; coined by Hadley Wickham of RStudio

o Similar to data cleaning but has specific rules/guidelines (i.e. typical epi datasets are not tidy)

*Prediciting counter factorial - Hernan*

# Questions

How do we find the advantages of the specific ML model that fit our problem?
- Should we test all models, and then chose based on predective performance?

How can we increase interpability of reuslts from ML e.g. random forrest? - Indentify the prediction are doing well in certain subgroups?

Feature Selection: Are more features always better? - Any risk by to many features


## Discrimination and calibration?

# Terms

recall = sensitivity

# Inspiration

Choose a model?

*Model selection* - Do the 70 / 30 split, bootstrapping, or cross-validation, on different models (cox, RFS, other?) - Select best model performance

*Model development* - Do the developing on the model whole dataset?

**Document the steps for developing the model** - import - tidy - transformation - model- evaluation
